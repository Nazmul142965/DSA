Try the following using Array 1.0

Part A

1. A teacher is inputting the marks of his students for a Mathematics test. The marks range
from 0 to 100.

i) Calculate the Average Marks of the Students:
Write a program to input the marks of n students and calculate the average marks.

ii) Find the Highest Mark:
Write a program to input the marks of n students and find the highest mark obtained in
the test.

iii) Find the Lowest Mark:
Write a program to input the marks of n students and find the lowest mark obtained in
the test.

iv) Count Students with Marks Above Average:
Write a program to input the marks of n students and calculate the average marks.
Then, count how many students scored marks above the average.

v) Calculate Grade Distribution:
Extend the previous program to categorize students' marks into different grade
bands: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), and F (below 60).
Output the count of students in each grade band.

vi) Identify Top Performers: (Bonus Marks)
Write a program to input the marks of n students and identify the top performers.
Consider the top 10% of students based on their marks as top performers.

2. Temperature Tracker:
You are developing a program to track the temperature of a room over a week. Write a C
program that uses an array to store the temperature readings for each day. The program
should allow the user to input the temperature readings for each day and display the highest
and lowest temperatures recorded during the week.
