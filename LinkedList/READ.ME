Practice Problems 4
Topic: Linked Lists

1. Write a code to create a linked list containing five nodes and display the values.
Nodes are:

p = 7
q = 5
r = 13
s = 10
t = 11

2. Now modify the previous code in such a way so that user can input the values in the
given nodes p,q,r,s,t by using loop.
3. Now update the same code in such a way so that user can define how many nodes
he/she wants to create then input the values in nodes.
