1. Write a code to implement the insertion of the following values into a Binary
Search Tree (BST):
35, 50, 40, 25, 30, 60, 78, 20, 28.
The code should insert nodes in a way that maintains the BST properties.
2. Write a code to search for a value which is taken from a user in the BST.
If the value is found, return True; otherwise, return False.
3. Write a code to find and return the minimum (lowest) value in the given BST.
4. Write a code to find and return the maximum (highest) value in the given BST.
